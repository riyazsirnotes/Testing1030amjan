Manual Testing :

Software : Set of instructions or programs to accomplish some task.

e.g : caalcualtor , messages , whatsapp etc ..


types of softwares :

1. System software : 

e.g : Operating systems , drivers ,etc..

2. Programming software: 

e.g : Compilers , interpreters ,debugging tools etc

3.Application Software :

web applications , Mobile applications , SAP applications , Desktop or standalone applications ,
mainframe applications , silverlite applications

Testing :

is a process of checking developed  software is working as per client business requirements or not .


finding defects or bugs

motto of testing is to deliver a quality product and deliver a risk free product

what do we test in now-a-days applications ( Web or Mobile applications)

- functionalities

- GUI

- Load Testing

- Performance Testing

- Usability

- 


how do we test ?

- Manual Testing :

testing activity carried for testing software applications(functional testing or load testing etc) using man effort .
Then it is called Manual Testing

- Automation Testing :

testing activity carried for testing software applications(functional testing or load testing etc) using

some tools like Selenium  / Cypress  / TOSCA  / UFT etc ..

Process of converting Test Cases to Test Scripts using some tool is called Automation

Terminologies in Software development or Testing :

- Project

if a software application developed for a specific customer .then it is called Project

- Product 

if a software application developed for multiple customers or user then it is called product

- Error :

Any incorrect human action or mistakes which gives wrong results

- Defect / Bug  / Fault :  

Deviation between expected behaviour to actual behaviour of the system is called defect.

Failure : if an end user identifies a defect while using the software application 
Then it is failure.

Note : 

presence of errors resultsin defects and presence of defects results in failure


why do a software application have defects ?

1) Incorrect requirements
2) Wrong design
3) wrong coding
4) poor coding
5) complex architecture
6) work pressure and time pressure
7) frequently change in business requirements

Now-a-days testing :

It's a process of checking are we developing right software or not and also checking developed
software is working or not

Software Testing = Verification +  Validation


Verification : It is process of checking are we developing right s/w or not

It is also called as Static Testing

Validation : It is process of checking developed software is working properly or not

It is also called as Dynamic Testing

*************************************************************

3rd Feb

what are roles or duties of tester ?

1) understanding application under test (AUT) 
2) Formal Testing (writing and executing test case)
3) Adhoc Testing (Informal Testing ) / No test cases
4) finding defects and reporting to developers
5) ReTesting and Regression testing
6) developing automation test scripts
7) executing automation test scripts
8) Analyse test results 
9) Prepare test reports

------------------------------------------------
Principle of software testing ?

7

1) Testing shows presence of defects 
2) Exhaustive testing is not possible
3) Early Testing
4) Pesticide Paradox
5) Defect Clustering
6) Testing is context(application) dependent / situtaion dependent
7) absence of defects is fallacy

SDLC :

software development life cycle


SDLC Models :

							SDLC Models
				
				Sequential 						Incremental
				
				1. Waterfall model				1. RAD (Rapid Application development)
				2. V-Model 						2. Prototype Model				
												3. Spiral Model			
												4. Agile Model
1. Waterfall Model

is well suited for small projects where requirements are clear

only validation
				

2. V Model
			
is well suited for small projects where requirements are not clear
so Early testing should be done

Verification + Validation

1. RAD (Rapid Application Development Model)
2. Prototype Model

This model is good for below scenario

  i) if customer is providing reference application
  ii) If customer requirements are not clear




**************************************************************
6th Feb Monday

Software Testing :

Static Testing :

It's a process of checking , are we developing right software or not

It's carried out in organization through reviews, inspection and Walk through's


Review : 

Examing a project related task is a Review

Requirments Review :

These reviews carried out by domain experts to find mistakes at requirements


Design Reviews :

These reviews carried out by Techincal / system experts to find out mistakesin design

Code Reviews :

These reviews carried out by Senoir developers to find devitaions in coding standards

NoOfLinks =10

Test Case Reviews :

These reviews carried out by Senoir Testers preferably test lead to check the test cases are
enough to test the project or not


Formal Reviews :

if any review is carried out by following proper review procedures or documentation


Inspection and Audit are best examples for Formal Reviews

Inspection : if a formal review carried out while executing a task

Audit : if a formal review carried out after execution of task

Informal Review :

if any review is carried out by without proper review procedures or documentation

Peer Reviews

Walk Through's :

Knowledge Transfer Sessions are called Walk Through's 


------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic Testing :

Whitebox Testing :

Testing conducted on the source code by developers to make sure developed code is 
working as expected or not 

unit testing and integration testing is collectively called as Whitebox testing


Unit Testing :

A smallest part in the source code of application such as programs , functions , methods  are
called units.

Testing conducted on these units is called Unit Testing

Integration Testing : 

once all units are tested , programs are combined together .
Testing conducted on overall output is called Integration Testing



Blackbox testing :

Testing conducted on the developed application by testers and also end users is called
blackbox testing.

7th Feb Tuesday


Functional System Testing Types :


1)Smoke Testing :

It is a kind of quick test or rough test performed on given application or build to decide 
whether it is eligible for further detailed testing or not

what to be verified in smoke testing ?

- we have to check all major functions are available ?

- we have to check the given application is consistently operable or not 

Objective of smoke testing iss to make sure whether given application is testable or not
- Not to find defects 

2) Formal Testing :

If we test a s/w application by following proper procedures and proper documentation.

In Simple words, writing test cases and excuting test cases.

recommended for maintenance projects

3) Adhoc Testing :

If we test a s/w application without following proper procedures and proper documentation.

- adhoc is perfomed for small projects or quick projects
- It is recommended for maintenance projects after Formal Testing


4)Priority Based Testing :

It is a process of deciding what to be tested first , what to test next and what to test last.


In other words , identifying important features in the product and testing them in order.


5)ReTesting

It is a process of validating reported defects/bugs are correctly resolved or not in 
modified build


6) Regression Testing :

It is a process of validating various functionalities in the modified build, where there is
a chance of getting side effects .

what is the diff b/n retesting and regression testing ?

Retesting performed modified build to make sure reported defects are correctly resolved

where as 

regression testing is perfomed on modified build for other features 


7)End to End Testing :

It is a process of checking over all functionalities of system from begining to end .

This will be carried out by senior testers preferably Test lead to make a decission whether
to stop testing or not

Special Functional System Testing :

1. BenchMark Testing 

It is a process of comparing our product with an established product in market.

It is required for products for which already competetors present in market


2. Exploratory Testing :

Exploring the application , understanding the application then testing it.

in two scenarios , we go for Exploratory 

- if requirement documentation is not available
- if requirements documentation is not providing sufficient  inputs


3) Monkey Testing :

Wantedly performing uneven operarations or zig-zag operarations with an intension of 
making system failure is called monkey testing


**************************************************************
8th Feb Wednesday

Sanity Testing :

Sanity test is done during the release phase to check for the main functionalities of application
without going deeper

Sanity testing is performed on stable builds 

It's a part of regression testing

It is planned when is there no enough time to do in-depth testing 

-------------------------------------------------------------

Non-Functional Testing :

Reponsiveness

Stability

Security

----------------------

time

speed 

user data volume 
----------------------------


Performance Testing :

	Load testing
	Stress testing
	Volume testing
	

mostly perforamce testing is done using tools 

jmeter ,  Load Runner , Neo Load etc ..


Performance Testing :

testing the reponse time of application under different conditions 

Load Testing :

testing the stability of the system under different loads (here different no of users)

we increase the load gradually and test the s/m

Stress Testing :

We suddenly increase the load and checking the stability

Volume Testing :

Here we test the user data volume capacity that s/m can hold


Security Testing :

Testing the security aspects 

---------------------------------------------------------
Globalization or Internationalization or I18N testing :

It is a process of checking end user having choice to configure different language options
(currency ,date and time foramt )

----------------------------------------------------------

Localization Testing :

IT's a process of checking default format,currency and language for the products designed for 
a specific locality of users

--------------------------------------------------------------

Recovery Testing:

IT's a process of checking how does our application handling unexpected or un predectible 
situtaion's like power failure , system crash , internet issues etc..


----------------------------------------------------------------

Installation Testing :

IT's a process of checking are we able to install the software successfully or not as per the
guidelines given in installation document.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

UnInstallation Testing :

IT's a process of checking are we able to uninstall the s/w successfully or not 
also the data clean up.

===========================================================================

User Acceptance testing :

Testing carried out by the end user on the delivered product to make sure whether it is ready for production or not.

UAT testing carried out in two ways :

1. Alpha Testing

It is first level of Acceptance testing carried out at company premises 

2. Beta Testing

It is last level of Acceptance testing carried out at customer premises
